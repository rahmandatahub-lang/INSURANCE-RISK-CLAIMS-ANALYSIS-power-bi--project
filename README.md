**Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis – Power BI Dashboard**
🏢 Project Overview
Insurance companies manage large volumes of policyholder and claims data across multiple systems. Due to scattered data sources, stakeholders often face challenges in tracking performance, identifying risk patterns, and making timely data-driven decisions.

This project focuses on building a centralized, interactive Power BI dashboard that provides clear insights into insurance policies, claims behavior, and risk factors using visual analytics.

****Business Objective****
The primary objective of this project is to help the insurance company:
Understand its policyholder base
Analyze claim patterns and financial impact
Identify high-risk customer segments
Support data-driven decision-making for underwriting, pricing, and risk management

**Business Problem**
Policy and claims data are spread across multiple sources
No single dashboard to track KPIs and trends
Difficulty in identifying risk drivers such as age, car type, usage, and demographics
Limited visibility into claim frequency and severity

KPI Requirements
The dashboard highlights the following key performance indicators:
Total Policies
Measures the size of the active policyholder base.
Total Claim Amount
Tracks the overall financial impact of claims.
Claim Frequency
Analyzes how frequently claims are being filed.
Average Claim Amount
Evaluates claim severity and potential risk exposure.
Gender-wise Total Policies
Understands customer distribution across genders for better segmentation.

**Visualization & Analysis Requirements****
To go beyond KPIs, multiple visualizations are used to explore policy and claim data across demographics, vehicle attributes, and customer behavior.
All visualizations are built using two dynamic measures:
Total Policies
Total Claim Amount

 Dashboard Visualizations
1️1 By Car Use (Donut Chart)

Analyzes policy count and claim amount based on car usage (Personal vs Commercial).

Helps identify higher-risk usage categories.

2 By Car Make (Bar Chart)

Identifies car brands associated with higher policies and claims.

Highlights brand-specific risk exposure.

3 By Coverage Zone (Donut Chart)

Evaluates policies and claims across geographic zones.

Supports regional risk assessment.

4️ By Age Group (Histogram / Frequency Chart)

Shows age distribution of policyholders.

Identifies age brackets with higher claim frequency.

5️ By Car Year (Area Chart)

Analyzes impact of vehicle age on policies and claims.

Reveals trends related to older vs newer vehicles.

6️ By Kids Driving (Ribbon Chart)

Compares policies and claims for households with young drivers.

Helps assess additional risk from inexperienced drivers.

7️ By Education (Pie Chart)

Explores correlation between education levels and insurance adoption.

Highlights claim behavior by education category.

8️ By Education & Marital Status (Matrix Heat Grid)

Examines combined demographic impact on policies and claims.

Identifies high-value and high-risk customer profiles.

**** Key Insights Derived****

Certain car makes and usage types contribute to higher claim amounts
Younger and very old age groups show higher claim frequency
Commercial vehicle usage carries higher risk than personal use
Households with kids driving tend to have increased claims
Specific education and marital status combinations show higher policy adoption and claim severity
